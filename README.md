---

## Instructions
This mod is very similar to other existing mods, so adapting it to your specific console shouldn't be difficult. Schematics or references from similar mods may be helpful. Remove the oscillator and mount the Pico as close as possible to the original board location.

- **5V** and **ground** can be easily connected to the holes left by removing the oscillator. It is recommended to use a diode (I used a 1n4001) on the 5V point if you plan to update the firmware with the mod installed.

- **MCLK** should be connected to the oscillator clock output.
  
-  **VCLK** is connected to the clock input pin of the 68000 (the VDP is also connected to this pin and must be disconnected from it). VCLK and ***GND 68K***, the connection should be made by twisting two wires between 25 and 30 AWG thick. One wire will be connected to the VCLK pin and the other to a GND pin on the 68000 processor. Use a GND pin on the 68000 as close as possible to the VCLK to maintain the twist until the end. Add an 82-ohm resistor in series with the VCLK pin of the processor. The resistor should be positioned as close as possible to the Raspberry Pi pin, preferably soldered to it. Do not use a wire for the connection between the VCLK and the GND of the 68000 that exceeds 10 cm.

- **Jpn/Export** and **NTSC/PAL** should be connected to the points on your board where +5V and ground determine the region and 50/60Hz respectively.

- **VRES** and **HALT** are connected to the corresponding pins on the 68000. HALT is optional if you do not wish to use the overclocking feature.

- **Pins 1, 6, 7 and 9** (add a 22k resistor to pin 7 of the controller for Model 1 VA0 to VA4) correspond to the pins of the first controller port, counting from 1 to 9 starting with the top left pin when facing the console.

- **Cart Enable** corresponds to pin B17 of the cartridge port. Pin B1 is the leftmost pin at the front, facing the console. This is used for TMSS bypass. If you are installing this on a non-TMSS console, this pin should probably be connected to ground.

- **MRES** corresponds to pin B2 on the cartridge port. It is used for TMSS bypass and reset in Master System mode, when a flashcart enters and exits special modes such as Master System or Sega CD.

- **M3 (B30)** corresponds to pin B30 of the cartridge port.

- **A23 (B11)** corresponds to pin B11 of the cartridge port.

- **Reset Button** correspond to pin 2 the button reset.
Add a voltage divider resistor for Model 1 VA5/VA6 on the reset button. Connect a 4.7k resistor to 5V and a 10k resistor to GND. The connection point between the two resistors should be connected to the Pi Pico's Reset Button pin.

- **RST, CS, DC, SCL, SDA, BLK and Detect Display** are only needed if you plan to use an LCD display.

- **Bluetooth up/down** will only be connected if used to control a retro Bluetooth module for wireless controllers.
  
- **Buzzer** needed only for connecting the Piezo Disc Transducer that will emit beep sounds during startup and functions. Connect the GND pin to ground and the + pin to a 100Ω resistor in series with the pico output pin.

If you want a LED to show the mod's status, use a common cathode bi-color LED. Connect the cathode to ground and the two anodes to pins LED1 and LED2. The region is indicated by color:

LED1 color indicates Japan
LED2 color indicates USA/Americas
A mix of both colors indicate Europe 50Hz
LED1 High + LED2 low indicate Europe 60Hz

Overclocking is indicated by the LED blinking at 3Hz when enabled.

Bluetooth is indicated by a flashing LED at 0.5Hz when activated.

**Setting up the Pico**

IMPORTANT: First, download the firmware image from the link [flash_nuke](https://github.com/DUSTINODELLOFFICIAL/openheart/blob/main/buid/flash_nuke.uf2) to remove any unnecessary files stored from previous Pico versions.

Flash the firmware onto the Pico by connecting it to the computer while holding down the BOOTSEL button. It will appear as a storage device simply drag the UF2 file onto it. The storage device will disconnect automatically.

Now, download the firmware image from this link [openheart.uf2](https://github.com/DUSTINODELLOFFICIAL/openheart/blob/main/buid/openheart30DEMO.uf2) and flash it onto the Pico by repeating the procedure already described.


**Installation examples here** [Here](https://github.com/DUSTINODELLOFFICIAL/openheart/tree/main/example).

**Pico pinout here** ![https://github.com/DUSTINODELLOFFICIAL/openheart/blob/main/pinout.png](https://github.com/DUSTINODELLOFFICIAL/openheart/blob/main/pinout.png)

**Notes & considerations**
Use at your own risk: The mod seems to work well on various Model 1 and Model 2 revisions, but not all revisions have been tested.

The first time the firmware is loaded, it automatically starts Bluetooth, so the LED will blink at 0.5Hz. Turn the console off and on again while pressing the UP button to deactivate and save the configuration.

Overclocking configures the CPU to have the master clock divided by 6 or 5 (the default is MCLK/7). This results in approximately 8MHz or 10.74MHz in the NTSC standard. Most games run well with this configuration, but be aware that crashes, graphical glitches, or controller malfunctions may still occur.

The clocks generated by the Pi Pico are imperceptibly different (+0.013% NTSC, -0.006% PAL) compared to the original oscillator specs. This is not noticeable, but may be relevant for speedrunners.

Switching between 50Hz and 60Hz, or toggling overclock on and off frequently during gameplay, may occasionally cause strange behavior. If this happens, just power cycle the console.

Some (few?) NTSC Model 1 VA7 and Model 2 VA0 consoles have a broken 50Hz mode). These consoles still work fine at 60Hz.

PAL mode composite video on NTSC consoles (and vice versa) may or may not work. RGB output will work. This may depend on your TV or the standard being used.

## Instruções

Este mod é muito semelhante a outros mods existentes, então adaptá-lo ao seu console específico não deve ser difícil. Esquemáticos ou referências de outros mods similares podem ser úteis. Remova o oscilador e monte o Pico o mais próximo possível da localização original da placa.

- **5V** e **terra** podem ser facilmente conectados aos furos deixados pela remoção do oscilador. Recomenda-se usar um diodo (eu usei um 1n4001) no ponto de 5V se você pretende atualizar o firmware com o mod instalado.
  
- **MCLK** deve ser conectado à saída de clock do oscilador.
  
- **VCLK** O pino VCLK está conectado ao pino de entrada de clock do 68000 (o VDP também está conectado a este pino e deve ser desconectado dele). A conexão entre ***VCLK*** e ***GND 68K*** deve ser feita torcendo dois fios de bitola entre 25 e 30 AWG. Um fio será conectado ao pino VCLK e o outro a um pino GND do processador 68000. Utilize um pino GND do 68000 o mais próximo possível do VCLK para manter a torção até o final. Adicione um resistor de 82 ohms em série com o pino VCLK do processador. O resistor deve ser posicionado o mais próximo possível do pino do Raspberry Pi, preferencialmente soldado a ele. Não utilize um fio com comprimento superior a 10 cm para a conexão entre o VCLK e o GND do 68000.
  
- **Jpn/Export** e **NTSC/PAL** devem ser conectados aos pontos da sua placa onde +5V e terra determinam a região e 50/60Hz, respectivamente.
  
- **VRES** e **HALT** são conectados aos pinos correspondentes do 68000.  HALT é opcional caso você não deseje usar o recurso de overclock.
  
Os **pinos 1, 6, 7 e 9** (adicionar resistor para pino 7 do controle (22k) model 1 va0 to va4) correspondem aos pinos da primeira porta de controle, contando de 1 a 9 começando pelo pino superior esquerdo visto de frente para o console.

- **Cart Enable** corresponde ao pino B17 da porta do cartucho. O pino B1 é o mais à esquerda na frente, voltado para o console. Isso é usado para o bypass do TMSS. Se você estiver instalando isso em um console sem TMSS, provavelmente deve conectar esse pino ao terra.
  
- **MRES** corresponde ao pino B2 da porta do cartucho. Isso é usado para o bypass do TMSS and reset in mode master system, quando um flashcart entra e sai de modos especiais como Master System ou Sega CD.

- **M3 (B30)** corresponde ao pino B30 da porta do cartucho.
  
- **A23 (B11)** corresponde ao pino B11 da porta do cartucho.

- **Reset Button** corresponde ao pino 2 do botão de reset.
Adicione um resistor divisor para o modelo 1 VA5/VA6 no botão de reset. Conecte um resitor de 4,7k no 5v e 10k no GND. O ponto de conexão entre os dois resistores deve ser conectado ao pino do botão de reset do Pi Pico.

- **RST, CS, DC, SCL, SDA, BLK e Detect Display** são necessários apenas se for utilizar display LCD.
  
- **Buzzer** necessário apenas para ligação do Transdutor Piezo Disco que irá emitir os sons de beep durante inicialização e funções. Ligue o pino GND ao terra e o pino + em um resitor de 100Ω em série com o pino de saida do pico.

- **Bluetooth up/down** será conectado apenas se for utilizado para controlar um módulo bluetooth retro para controles sem fio.
  

Se quiser um LED que mostre o estado do mod, use um LED bicolor de cátodo comum. Conecte o cátodo ao terra e os dois ânodos aos pinos LED1 e LED2. A região é indicada pela cor:

Cor do LED1 indica Japão
Cor do LED2 indica EUA/Américas
Mistura das duas cores indica Europa 50Hz
Cor do LED1 High + Cor do LED2 baixa indica Europa 60Hz

O overclock é indicado por um piscar do LED a 3Hz quando ativado.

O Bluetooth é indicado por um piscar do LED a 0,5Hz quando ativado.

**Configurando o pico**

IMPORTANTE: Primeiro, baixe a imagem do firmware do link [flash_nuke](https://github.com/DUSTINODELLOFFICIAL/openheart/blob/main/buid/flash_nuke.uf2) para remover quaisquer arquivos desnecessários armazenados de versões anteriores do Pico.

Grave o firmware no Pico conectando-o ao computador enquanto mantém pressionado o botão BOOTSEL. Ele aparecerá como um dispositivo de armazenamento — basta arrastar o arquivo UF2 para ele. O dispositivo de armazenamento será desconectado automaticamente.

Agora, baixe a imagem do firmware deste link [openheart.uf2](https://github.com/DUSTINODELLOFFICIAL/openheart/blob/main/buid/openheart30DEMO.uf2) e grave-a no Pico repetindo o procedimento já descrito.

**Exemplos de instalação** [aqui](https://github.com/DUSTINODELLOFFICIAL/openheart/tree/main/example).

**Notas e considerações**
Use por sua conta e risco: O mod parece funcionar bem em várias revisões dos modelos 1 e 2, mas nem todas as revisões foram testadas.

A primeira vez que o firmware é carregado, ele inicia o bluetooth automaticamente, sendo assim o LED irá ficar piscando a 0,5Hz. Desligue e ligue o console com o UP pressionado para desativar e salvar a configuração. 

O overclocking configura a CPU para o clock mestre dividido por 6 ou 5 (o padrão é MCLK/7). Isso resulta em cerca de 8MHz ou 10,74 MHz no padrão NTSC A maioria dos jogos funciona bem com essa configuração, mas esteja ciente de que travamentos, falhas gráficas ou mau funcionamento do controle ainda podem ocorrer.

Os clocks gerados pelo Pi Pico são imperceptivelmente diferentes (+0,013% no NTSC, -0,006% no PAL) em relação às especificações originais do oscilador. Isso não é perceptível, mas pode ser relevante para speedrunners.

Alternar entre 50Hz e 60Hz, ou ativar/desativar o overclock com frequência durante o jogo, pode ocasionalmente causar comportamentos estranhos. Se isso acontecer, basta reiniciar o console.

Alguns (poucos?) consoles NTSC Model 1 VA7 e Model 2 VA0 têm o modo 50Hz quebrado "têm o modo 50Hz quebrado"). Esses consoles ainda funcionam normalmente em 60Hz.

O vídeo composto em modo PAL em consoles NTSC (e vice-versa) pode ou não funcionar. A saída RGB funcionará. Isso pode depender da sua TV ou do padrão utilizado.
